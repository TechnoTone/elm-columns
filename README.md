# Elm Columns [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/790abe46-307d-414a-a863-2c00991e960f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/elm-columns/deploys)


A simple Columns game written in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org).


### Why?
To help in my personal journey getting to know Elm I thought it would help to have a small, well defined goal to work on. I wanted to practice with the language itself but also to experience parts of it that I wasn't really being exposed to in my day job. Things like animation, responsiveness, touch-screen controls, etc.

I have memories of enjoying a Columns game in my youth. Many people know the game Tetris but Columns seems not to be quite so well known and there are not nearly as many versions available to play today.

And so here's a version of the game ready to be accessed and played directly from the web on PC, phone, tablet, etc.
